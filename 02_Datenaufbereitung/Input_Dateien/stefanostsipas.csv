The person that made you want to go out at the tennis courts in the beach, made you dream about playing on all of the big stages and arenas around the world, winning trophies and titles, becoming an inspiration for others. Despite being at the end of his career, my childhood was filled with @petesamprasofficial matches and battles that I will never forget. This person has given me courage and eagerness to pursue my dream. A dream that felt insanely difficult to reach... it’s an honor to be standing next to you Pete. Thank you for filling my childhood with enthusiasm, hope, hard work ethic and an eager for me to play tennis in the first place. You are an inspiration up to this day, and I hope and inspiration for many generations to come."
