2018-11-13_21-24-32_UTC.txt,"RIP Kyle. It’s hard to explain how much I loved you and how instrumental you were in making me who I am today. My heart and everyone who knew you is absolutely broken. You touched so many lives in the best possible way. You were a stud Florida Gator football player, me a Georgia Bulldog tennis player. Despite our crazy differences, we forged an inseparable bond. You were the most knowledgeable strength coach ever and the years we spent in the gym together allowed me to compete at the highest level. You were the best damn chef I’ve ever seen. I will miss so much the wings we’d cook together on NFL Sunday. More than anything, you were a friend, the best friend I could ever ask for. Kyle Steven Morgan, I love you bro. Gone but never forgotten."

2018-12-08_00-50-35_UTC.txt,"#AD Pain management isn’t just about relieving pain today, it’s also about addressing future pain. The #Avail TENS device made by @OmronHealthcareUS has helped me with both. I’ve learned that #TENS therapy blocks pain messaging to the brain, stimulates the release of endorphins naturally, and improves blood circulation. It’s completely drug-free and you can use it at home, which is great for me, and anyone else dealing with pain. Plus, the Avail is wireless, affordable, and FDA-cleared, making home pain relief very easy and comfortable for me. I highly recommend getting your own Avail. Check out the link in my bio for more info. #OmronHealthcare #PainManagement"
