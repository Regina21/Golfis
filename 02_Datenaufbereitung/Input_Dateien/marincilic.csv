I was really eager to play in Cincinnati, where I've won my first-career ATP Masters 1000 singles title last year and where I had one of the best performances during my career, but I still don't feel at 100% to compete at the top level and to defend my title there. I have already started with my preparation and the progress is going well but there isn't enough time for me to prepare for Cincinnati and to be completely ready to play there. Still, I feel very confident that I will be back in action very soon, and I am looking forward to the upcoming US Open.
