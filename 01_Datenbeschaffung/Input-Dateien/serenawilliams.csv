2018-08-06_22-24-23_UTC.txt,"Last week was not easy for me. Not only was I accepting some tough personal stuff, but I just was in a funk. Mostly, I felt like I was not a good mom.  I read several articles that said postpartum emotions can last up to 3 years if not dealt with. I like communication best. Talking things through with my mom, my sisters, my friends let me know that my feelings are totally normal.  It’s totally normal to feel like I’m not doing enough for my baby.  We have all been there. I work a lot, I train, and I’m trying to be the best athlete I can be.  However, that means although I have been with her every day of her life, I’m not around as much as I would like to be. Most of you moms deal with the same thing. Whether stay-at-home or working, finding that balance with kids is a true art. You are the true heroes.  I’m here to say: if you are having a rough day or week--it’s ok--I am, too!!!

So if it means warming up and stretching while holding my baby that’s what #thismama will do. My fellow moms and dads working- or stay home it’s equally as intense- but you inspire me. Hearing your stories makes me know I can do this. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. This year is to you! What are some things you had to do while working? #thismama #thisdaddy

2019-01-09_23-02-58_UTC.txt,"This week, my “S” stands for Serena. My @Serena S Melbourne shirts are limited and available online. Link in bio. #ThisMama realized last week I had not had a proper pedicure since before I had Olympia (I now paint my own nails fun but not as relaxing). She is 16 months now!!! I used to go every week as a way to relax. It was literally my favorite thing to do. But ever since I had the baby, I feel overwhelmed with guilt if I want to take “Serena” time. As a working mom, I feel like my “extra” time should be spent with my daughter. I have been told a million times (and even by you all) to take care of myself so I can take care of my child. I hear it, but it’s harder to put into practice as a first time mom. Do any of you ever experience mom guilt?  Stresses of life can really get to you and I finally decided to take the first step in doing something for me. So every Saturday or Sunday I try to take time to do something for me (even if it’s just an hour). So to my fellow moms and dads out there: don’t forget to give yourself a little love too. #thismama #thisdaddy Get your limited “S” Melbourne and show me YOUR ‘S’ at the Aussie Open or by tagging @serena"
