Unfortunately, this resulted in foot surgery that will have me sidelined for the next few months. The good news is that surgery was successful and I have already started rehab! Shooting for a summer '17 return! Wish me luck and please root me on, I can't wait to get back on court! I appreciate all of your love, it means the world to me"
