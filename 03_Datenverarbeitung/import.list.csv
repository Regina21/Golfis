Itâ€™s completely drug-free and you can use it at home, which is great for me, and anyone else dealing with pain.

I took 6 months off last season hoping to come back fully recovered, but unfortunately I still felt pain. I really missed competing, itâ€™s in my blood and I had to give it a try on AO. Anyhow, I agreed with my team that I would try different methods after I finish in Australia and a few days ago I accepted to do a small medical intervention on my elbow. It seems like I am on the good road now to full recovery. Itâ€™s quite a journey this one, I have to say. Iâ€™m learning a lot and for that Iâ€™m grateful. Iâ€™ve always taken care of my body and looked for the most natural ways to heal, and my body has rewarded me with some incredible years on tour.

2018-07-19,21-03-57_UTC.txt,"[Part 1] Dear Family & Friends,  I am writing this message between nappy change and a dinosaurs ğŸ¦• book.  I wish to share, with all of you, how it felt to go through the journey of winning Wimbledon 2018.  First of all, let me start by writing that the feeling of having my son in my wifeâ€™s arms at the trophy ceremony in the Playerâ€™s box was the most wonderful sensation I have had at any tournament that I have ever won in my career.  When I became a father, one of my biggest dreams was to have my children present at the stands while I am playing. Let alone winning trophies. That dream came true several days ago. Everyone keeps on asking me to describe the feeling. I have said it is unforgettable, special, fulfilling, wonderful, joyful. But most of all, it is magical! When I thought that moment could not get any better, he shouted â€œDaddy, Daddy!â€œ. Thatâ€™s when I completely melted. Overwhelmed with emotions. Happy and joyful beyond belief. I am so GRATEFUL to have experienced that.  I have imagined and prayed that one day I would win a Grand Slam trophy in front of my child. Luckily for me, Tara is growing up and I canâ€™t wait for her to see me do the same as I did in front of Stefan. My whole (more or less) was about tennis until I became a father and husband. Everything I did was aimed at tennis success.  When I became father and husband, my â€œworldâ€ evolved. It didnâ€™t change, it evolved into something more beautiful. Of course, more responsibilities add up but at the end of the day, it unlocks a new dimension of Love and Energy inside of you that you never knew existed. And the biggest gift that you receive from God is the enhanced feeling of empathy, compassion and devotion to your kids. But itâ€™s not all clear once you become a father. It takes learning and openness to reach that â€œgolden balanceâ€ in Life which everyone is in pursuit for. For me it was balance between tennis, priorities and family. My wife was so helpful and supportive all the way since she gave birth to both Stefan and Tara. She always took time to discuss whatever bothered me and to help me find a way where I can feel like I am giving my best at home with kids and her and at the tennis court."," novakdjokovic "
2018-07-19,21-06-37_UTC.txt,"[Part 2] In 2017, the injury of my right elbow was so severe that I was forced to be out from the Tour for 6 months. Injury was one of the issues, the other big one was any motivation. I didnâ€™t have problems to practice and to enjoy the tennis court but I had mental hurdles when I had to compete.  One day I will share more in depth what kind of challenges I had to face and how I felt.  I have always respected people that share their most vulnerable moments as their turning points in finding true strength that inspires so many people. I was vulnerable so many times in the last few years. And I am still vulnerable. I am not ashamed of it. In contrary, it makes me more true to myself and others. It allows me to get closer to people. It allows me to â€œdig deepâ€ and analyze what is truly happening inside of me. When I find that out, I am able to create a strategy to overcome this occurring issue and move on as a stronger, wiser, happier human being.  For the last 2 years, I wasnâ€™t patient with my tennis expectations. I wasnâ€™t wise in strategizing. And I certainly wasnâ€™t clearly hearing my body telling me that there is something serious happening with my elbow. I was trying to find solutions somewhere else and soliton was always inside of me.  After many changes made with training, racket, team members, I didnâ€™t know if I would be able to get back on the desired level of tennis. Actually, one part of me always believes in my own qualities and capabilities. But there was a lot of doubtful moments where course of action could have gone different ways.  Fortunately, I had help from all the divine forces that guided me to the right direction. Direction that is good for me. The one that will bring me peace and balance."," novakdjokovic "

It means the world to me and I know it wasnâ€™t easy to stick around when things were uncertain. So thank you! _ UnBELIEVEable is usually the most common way to explain extraordinary success.. To me, that expression negates the most powerful emotion that one can have - BELIEF. All this time, belief is what pushed me through moments of doubt, pain, uncertainty. I was stuck at some point and overwhelmed by a plethora of information. And the results were not showing. Everybody offered their opinions and advice on what to do and what was happening to me, and I canâ€™t say I didnâ€™t hear any of it. I did. I got confused at times. But there was one thing that kept me up, kept me going: Belief in myself, my abilities, my skills and talent, and my resilience. Belief that I am meant to do this. _ The biggest takeaway from these fantastic past few months is that UNBELIEVABLE doesnâ€™t exist. Limits do not exist. When you see it in your mind, you can achieve it in life. When you show up with your courage, confidence and belief, you are already a winner despite the actual result. Your character prevails and you build your habits and your habits bring you one step closer to your goals. So my friends, embrace adversity and trust in the power of belief.. it can take you anywhere ğŸ’ª Love to all. Idemooo #USOpen"," novakdjokovic "

His wife Mija and him accepted Jelena GenÄiÄ‡â€™s request for me to come to his academy in Germany when I was 12 years old even though he usually did not accept players under 14. He had one of the best European tennis academies at the time. Mija and Niki treated me as their own child and did the same for my 2 younger brothers. My family will always remember that. _ Niki is 80 this year and he still plays tennis 4h a day. His mindset is remarkable. He is healthy and super passionate about tennis - court is his home. He was a very successful player and even more successful coach. He is the only tennis coach to win 5 different Davis Cup titles with 3 different nations (Germany, Croatia, Serbia). _ Niki is one of the most important tennis and life mentors Iâ€™ve ever had. My time spent in his academy has greatly impacted my game and career. I am eternally grateful Mija and Niki for everything you have done for me and my family ğŸ™ğŸ™Œâ¤ BaÅ¡ dirljiv momenat.

Iâ€™ve been carrying this injury for the past two years, and during this time Iâ€™ve been seeing many doctors. Truth be told, there were many different opinions, different diagnoses, different suggestions... It was not easy for me to choose which way to go and what to do. I took 6 months off last season hoping to come back fully recovered, but unfortunately I still felt pain. I really missed competing, itâ€™s in my blood and I had to give it a try on AO. Anyhow, I agreed with my team that I would try different methods after I finish in Australia and a few days ago I accepted to do a small medical intervention on my elbow. It seems like I am on the good road now to full recovery. Itâ€™s quite a journey this one, I have to say. Iâ€™m learning a lot and for that Iâ€™m grateful. Iâ€™ve always taken care of my body and looked for the most natural ways to heal, and my body has rewarded me with some incredible years on tour. I am super positive and excited to follow my recovery through so I can come back to the place I love the most. The court. Iâ€™ll keep you posted and thanks for cheering me on!

It means the world to me and I know it wasnâ€™t easy to stick around when things were uncertain. So thank you! _ UnBELIEVEable is usually the most common way to explain extraordinary success.. To me, that expression negates the most powerful emotion that one can have - BELIEF. All this time, belief is what pushed me through moments of doubt, pain, uncertainty. I was stuck at some point and overwhelmed by a plethora of information. And the results were not showing. Everybody offered their opinions and advice on what to do and what was happening to me, and I canâ€™t say I didnâ€™t hear any of it. I did. I got confused at times. But there was one thing that kept me up, kept me going: Belief in myself, my abilities, my skills and talent, and my resilience. Belief that I am meant to do this. _ The biggest takeaway from these fantastic past few months is that UNBELIEVABLE doesnâ€™t exist. Limits do not exist. When you see it in your mind, you can achieve it in life. When you show up with your courage, confidence and belief, you are already a winner despite the actual result. Your character prevails and you build your habits and your habits bring you one step closer to your goals. So my friends, embrace adversity and trust in the power of belief.. it can take you anywhere ğŸ’ª Love to all. Idemooo #USOpen Fresh air, sun is shining, healthy bodies. We are blessed.

I wish to share, with all of you, how it felt to go through the journey of winning Wimbledon 2018.  First of all, let me start by writing that the feeling of having my son in my wifeâ€™s arms at the trophy ceremony in the Playerâ€™s box was the most wonderful sensation I have had at any tournament that I have ever won in my career.  When I became a father, one of my biggest dreams was to have my children present at the stands while I am playing. Let alone winning trophies. That dream came true several days ago. Everyone keeps on asking me to describe the feeling. I have said it is unforgettable, special, fulfilling, wonderful, joyful. But most of all, it is magical! When I thought that moment could not get any better, he shouted â€œDaddy, Daddy!â€œ. Thatâ€™s when I completely melted. Overwhelmed with emotions. Happy and joyful beyond belief. I am so GRATEFUL to have experienced that.  I have imagined and prayed that one day I would win a Grand Slam trophy in front of my child. Luckily for me, Tara is growing up and I canâ€™t wait for her to see me do the same as I did in front of Stefan. My whole (more or less) was about tennis until I became a father and husband. Everything I did was aimed at tennis success.  When I became father and husband, my â€œworldâ€ evolved. It didnâ€™t change, it evolved into something more beautiful. Of course, more responsibilities add up but at the end of the day, it unlocks a new dimension of Love and Energy inside of you that you never knew existed. And the biggest gift that you receive from God is the enhanced feeling of empathy, compassion and devotion to your kids. But itâ€™s not all clear once you become a father. It takes learning and openness to reach that â€œgolden balanceâ€ in Life which everyone is in pursuit for. For me it was balance between tennis, priorities and family. My wife was so helpful and supportive all the way since she gave birth to both Stefan and Tara. She always took time to discuss whatever bothered me and to help me find a way where I can feel like I am giving my best at home with kids and her and at the tennis court. You have been a blessing to everyone since you arrived in our lives. I am so grateful to have you as my son, my brave falcon ğŸ¦…and knight ğŸ›¡ You shine light and love â¤ on our souls. Thank you for teaching us how to be present, to enjoy and smile, to forgive and move on. Happy Birthday ğŸ‰ my dear son. Love you â¤ _ Blagosloveni smo tvojim dolaskom u naÅ¡e Å¾ivote. Zahvalan sam Å¡to te imam za sina, mog hrabrog sokolağŸ¦… i viteza ğŸ›¡Hvala ti Å¡to sijaÅ¡ svetlost i ljubav ğŸ™â¤ Hvala ti Å¡to nastavljaÅ¡ da nas uÄiÅ¡ kako da svesno Å¾ivimo, da budemo prisutni, sreÄ‡ni i nasmejani i kako da praÅ¡tamo i nastavljamo dalje.

Injury was one of the issues, the other big one was any motivation. I didnâ€™t have problems to practice and to enjoy the tennis court but I had mental hurdles when I had to compete.  One day I will share more in depth what kind of challenges I had to face and how I felt.  I have always respected people that share their most vulnerable moments as their turning points in finding true strength that inspires so many people. I was vulnerable so many times in the last few years. And I am still vulnerable. I am not ashamed of it. In contrary, it makes me more true to myself and others. It allows me to get closer to people. It allows me to â€œdig deepâ€ and analyze what is truly happening inside of me. When I find that out, I am able to create a strategy to overcome this occurring issue and move on as a stronger, wiser, happier human being.  For the last 2 years, I wasnâ€™t patient with my tennis expectations. I wasnâ€™t wise in strategizing. And I certainly wasnâ€™t clearly hearing my body telling me that there is something serious happening with my elbow. I was trying to find solutions somewhere else and soliton was always inside of me.  After many changes made with training, racket, team members, I didnâ€™t know if I would be able to get back on the desired level of tennis. Actually, one part of me always believes in my own qualities and capabilities. But there was a lot of doubtful moments where course of action could have gone different ways.  Fortunately, I had help from all the divine forces that guided me to the right direction. Direction that is good for me. The one that will bring me peace and balance. First practice! #TeamDjokovic is getting ready for #wimbledon Excited!!! ğŸ‘ğŸ¼â˜º Work out time outdoors. I love this kind of training.

I read several articles that said postpartum emotions can last up to 3 years if not dealt with. I like communication best. Talking things through with my mom, my sisters, my friends let me know that my feelings are totally normal.  Itâ€™s totally normal to feel like Iâ€™m not doing enough for my baby.  We have all been there. I work a lot, I train, and Iâ€™m trying to be the best athlete I can be.  However, that means although I have been with her every day of her life, Iâ€™m not around as much as I would like to be. Most of you moms deal with the same thing. Whether stay-at-home or working, finding that balance with kids is a true art. You are the true heroes.  Iâ€™m here to say: if you are having a rough day or week--itâ€™s ok--I am, too!!!
